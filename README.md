> Sadly, I'm no longer able to keep up maintenance of this project. The app uses decade-old APIs that are no longer well supported in the latest Android versions, and the BART APIs this app uses have become buggy and poorly supported. This app would essentially need a rewrite to use BART's [GTFS-RT feed](https://www.bart.gov/schedules/developers/gtfs-realtime) and modern Android APIs. Since I'm no longer able to dedicate enough time to the rewrite and maintenance of the app, the app has been unpublished from the Play Store.

This is my "fun project", where I get a chance to work my Android development muscles and hopefully create something free and useful for the SF Bay Area community.
